## RGBDS flavoured Z80 Assembly for Sublime Text
Syntax definitions - and maybe some snippets later - for the Z80 assembly syntax used by the rgbasm assembler in [RGBDS](https://github.com/rednex/rgbds).

## Motivation
There is a Z80 assembly package for ST, but it's for the Pasmo Z80 cross assembler, and as such won't really work well if you prefer using RGBDS for Game Boy development like I do.

## Status
There's a bare minimum syntax definition, that colours most things helpfully, but I'd like to add some more scopes to allow more user-friendly syntax highlighting.
